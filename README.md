# Java-TextEditor
This is a coursera course project.
[Link to the Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming)

The project builds a smart text editor/processor that incorporates “intelligent” behaviors of modern-day text interfaces including autocomplete, flagging misspelled words and spelling auto-correct.

## Code design
The code you’ll be developing here is what’s called “back-end” code, in that you’ll be working with the text, and not directly with any user interface components.  This is so that you can really dig in and experiment with the different data structures you are learning and the running times for each of them.  However, we provide you with a snazzy user interface (aka “front-end”)  so that you can see the application of all of the functionality you implement.  This division of behavior (front-end vs. back-end) is typical in intermediate and large-scale software design.   However, if you feel inspired, you’re always welcome to play with the front-end code as well.  Although we will not explicitly cover it in this course, we encourage you to seek external resources and play around if you are interested.

## Tech Stack
* Describe the difference between an abstract data type (ADT) and its implementation.
* Work with Java's built-in classes for fundamental data structures including: String, LinkedList, TreeSet, HashSet, and HashMap.
* Analyze the performance of code, using Big-O notation as well as through benchmarking experiments.
* Write JUnit tests to ensure the correctness of your code.
